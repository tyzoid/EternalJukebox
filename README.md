# EternalJukebox

This repository is a fork which fixes bugs because the upstream repo is unmaintained.

You can visit the hosted instance of this repository [here](https://v90084.1blu.de/), in case you want to mess around with it without doing all the hard stuff.

The source files for the EternalJukebox, a rehosting of the Infinite Jukebox.
This repo contains everything you need to host the EternalJukebox on your own server!

# Docker Install

## Prerequisites

You need to install [docker](https://docs.docker.com/engine/install/) and [docker-compose](https://docs.docker.com/compose/install/)

## Configuration

To configure, grab `.env.example` from this repository, rename it to `.env` and change the appropriate values.

You'll also need `envvar_config.yaml`, but only edit this if you want some advanced configuration.

## Running

You can use the following `docker-compose.yaml` as a starting point to run the application without needing a database running, if you want to use a db refer to the main `docker-compose.yaml`.

```yaml
version: "3"

services:
  main:
    image: daviirodrig/eternaljukebox
    ports:
      - 8080:8080
    env_file:
      - .env
    volumes:
      - "./envvar_config.yaml:/EternalJukebox/envvar_config.yaml"
```

To start, run `docker compose up -d` in the folder containing `envvar_config.yaml`, `.env` and `docker-compose.yaml`. To stop, run `docker compose down`.

If you want to you can upgrade the image by pulling the newest with `docker pull daviirodrig/eternaljukebox` and then restart with `docker compose down` and `docker compose up -d`

If you want to change the port from 8080, edit `docker-compose.yml` port, to be `- <your port>:8080`

# Manual Install

I highly recommend using Docker, as it is the easiest way to get the Eternal Jukebox up and running. If you want to use Docker, follow the instructions in the Docker Install section. Otherwise, you can try following this section.

## Prerequisites

### Java:

##### Windows

Download and install Java from https://www.java.com/en/download/

##### Debian-based Linux distributions

For Ubuntu or Debian-based distributions execute `sudo apt-get install default-jre` in the terminal

##### Fedora and CentOS

There is a tutorial for installing java on Fedora and CentOS at https://www.digitalocean.com/community/tutorials/how-to-install-java-on-centos-and-fedora

### Yt-dlp (a more up-to-date fork of Youtube-dl):

##### Windows

Download the .exe at https://github.com/yt-dlp/yt-dlp/releases/latest/download/yt-dlp.exe and place it in `C:\Windows\`, or in another folder on the PATH.

##### Linux

Use these commands in the terminal to install youtube-dl on Linux:
`sudo curl -L https://github.com/yt-dlp/yt-dlp/releases/latest/download/yt-dlp -o /usr/local/bin/yt-dlp`
`sudo chmod a+rx /usr/local/bin/yt-dlp`

### ffmpeg:

##### Windows

Download the exe from https://ffmpeg.zeranoe.com/builds/ and place it in `C:\Windows\`, or in another folder on teh PATH.

##### Linux

ffmpeg is available to download in most distributions using `sudo apt-get install ffmpeg` or equivalent

## Getting the project files:

You'll need to obtain a copy of [Gradle](https://gradle.org/install/), likely a [JDK](http://www.oracle.com/technetwork/java/javase/downloads/jdk8-downloads-2133151.html), and [Jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com/). You'll also need the project files in some capacity, be it `git clone` or downloading the archive from GitHub.

From there, building in Gradle is simple; just run `./gradlew clean shadowJar` from the project file directory. That should produce a jar file in `build/libs` that will work for you. In addition, you'll need to build the Jekyll webpages, which can be done by running `jekyll build --source _web --destination web`

```sh
git clone https://github.com/tyzoid/EternalJukebox.git
cd EternalJukebox
./gradlew clean shadowJar
jekyll build --source _web --destination web
```

## Configuring

First thing to do is create a new file called either `config.yaml` or `config.json` (YAML tends to be easier to write, but takes up slightly more space), then open it with notepad/notepad++ on Windows and whatever text editor you like on Linux (for example nano: `nano config.json`)

Now you should go to https://developer.spotify.com/my-applications/ and log in to your spotify account.
Then click the "Create an app" button and a new page should popup.
There give it a name and description and click create.
It should send you to the new app's page, the only thing you need from here is your Client ID and Client Secret
(Note: Never share these with anyone!)

You will also need a Youtube Data API key, which you can find about how to obtain [here](https://developers.google.com/youtube/v3/getting-started).

There are a variety of config options (documentation coming soon) that allow most portions of the EternalJukebox to be configured, and these can be entered here.

## Starting the server:

First you need to open the Terminal or Command Prompt.
Then make sure its running in the folder that your EternalJukebox.jar is in, once again to do this use the `cd` command.
Then execute the jar with `java -jar EternalJukebox.jar`

If everything went right it should say `Listening at http://0.0.0.0:8080`

you should now be able to connect to it with a browser through http://localhost:8080

Congrats you did it!

## Manually Building

This is not recommended unless you're making some modifications, and as such should only be performed by more advanced users

You'll need to obtain a copy of [Gradle](https://gradle.org/install/), likely a [JDK](https://www.oracle.com/java/technologies/javase/jdk11-archive-downloads.html), and [Jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com/). You'll also need the project files in some capacity, be it `git clone` or downloading the archive from GitHub.

From there, building in Gradle is simple; just run `gradle clean shadowJar` from the project file directory. That should produce a jar file in `build/libs` that will work for you. In addition, you'll need to build the Jekyll webpages, which can be done by running `jekyll build --source _web --destination web`
